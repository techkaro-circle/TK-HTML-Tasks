## How to do HTML Tasks?
* You first need HTML to complete these tasks.

Watch the [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/bKzNhlM_E4A) on how to do HTML tasks.

You will be given a concept / a screenshot / an existing website. Your job is to identify HTML elements in it and create a web page yourself using HTML and CSS.

## How to do styling in HTML Tasks?

* After adding complete HTML, you can now use your CSS concepts to apply styling on the webpage you just build with HTML
 - Hyperlinks styling
 - Icon buttons
 - Basic layout
 - Positioning
 - Pseudo classes
 - Combinators

### How are the tasks named?
Each task is named using the format `number-taskname`. The number signifies task difficulty on a scale of 10. So `05-sometask` will be more difficult than `02-anothertask`.
